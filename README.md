## üìã Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (any language)
- Computer with Windows 11, macOS, or Linux
- Internet connection for downloading Go

## üõ† Setup Instructions

### Windows 11 Setup

#### Option 1: Native Windows Installation

1. **Download Go**
   - Visit [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
   - Download the Windows installer (`.msi` file)
   - Run the installer and follow the setup wizard

2. **Verify Installation**
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
   - Run: `go version`
   - You should see output like: `go version go1.21.x windows/amd64`

3. **Set Up Environment (if needed)**
   - Go installer usually sets up PATH automatically
   - If not, add `C:\Go\bin` to your PATH environment variable

4. **Choose a Code Editor**
   - **VS Code** (Recommended): Download from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
     - Install the "Go" extension by Google
   - **GoLand**: JetBrains IDE specifically for Go
   - **Any text editor**: Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc.

#### Option 2: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

1. **Enable WSL**
   ```powershell
   # Run in PowerShell as Administrator
   wsl --install
   # Restart your computer when prompted
   ```

2. **Install Ubuntu**
   ```powershell
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   ```

3. **Update Ubuntu**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

4. **Install Go in WSL**
   ```bash
   # Remove any old Go installation
   sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
   
   # Download Go (check for latest version at https://golang.org/dl/)
   wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   
   # Extract to /usr/local
   sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   
   # Add Go to PATH
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

### macOS Setup

1. **Using Homebrew (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Install Homebrew if you don't have it
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   
   # Install Go
   brew install go
   ```

2. **Manual Installation**
   - Download macOS installer from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
   - Run the installer package

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

### Linux Setup

1. **Ubuntu/Debian**
   ```bash
   # Update package list
   sudo apt update
   
   # Install Go
   sudo apt install golang-go
   
   # Or install latest version manually:
   wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
   sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/ly2xxx/golang_lab.git

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Use This Tutorial

### For Beginners
1. **Follow lessons sequentially** - Each builds on previous concepts
2. **Type the code yourself** - Don't just copy-paste
3. **Experiment** - Modify examples and see what happens
4. **Read error messages** - Go has helpful error messages
5. **Practice** - Do the "Try It Yourself" sections

### For Experienced Programmers
1. **Jump to specific topics** - Use the lesson structure to find what you need
2. **Focus on Go-specific concepts** - Especially lessons 4, 5, 7, 8
3. **Build projects** - Combine concepts from multiple lessons

### Running Individual Lessons

```bash
# Navigate to any lesson
cd lesson01-hello-world

# Run the code
go run main.go

# Or build and run
go build -o hello main.go
./hello
```

### Running Web Server Lessons

```bash
# For lessons 9 and 10
cd lesson09-web-server
go run main.go
# Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser

cd lesson10-json-rest-api
go run main.go
# Test API with curl or visit http://localhost:8080/api
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "go: command not found"**
- Go is not installed or not in PATH
- Restart terminal after installation
- Check PATH: `echo $PATH` (Linux/Mac) or `echo $env:PATH` (Windows PowerShell)

**2. "package main is not in GOPATH"**
- You're using an old version of Go
- Update to Go 1.11+ which has module support
- Or run from correct directory

**3. "port already in use" (Lessons 9-10)**
- Another service is using port 8080
- Change port in main.go: `:8080` ‚Üí `:8081`
- Or kill existing process

**4. Permission errors (Linux/Mac)**
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /usr/local/go
```

### WSL-Specific Issues

**1. "cannot connect to server" when running web servers**
- Windows Firewall might be blocking
- Try accessing via `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- In WSL2, you might need the Windows IP

**2. File permission issues**
```bash
chmod +x test_api.sh  # Make script executable
```
